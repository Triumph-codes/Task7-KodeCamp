FastAPI Portfolio: A Series of Backend Projects

This repository contains a collection of five independent backend projects built using FastAPI. Each project is a self-contained application designed to demonstrate proficiency in building robust, secure, and well-structured APIs. The projects showcase a progression of skills, from fundamental API design to advanced features like database integration, authentication, and custom middleware.

```
üìÅ Repository Structure
The repository is organized with each task residing in its own folder. Each folder is a complete FastAPI project with a clean, modular structure.

```

Task_1_Student_Management_System/

Task_2_E-Commerce_API/

Task_3_Job_Application_Tracker/

Task_4_Notes_API/

Task_5_Contact_Manager_API/

```

Each project folder contains the following:

app/: The main application package.

main.py: The entry point of the application.

models.py: Defines SQLModel database schemas.

routers/: Contains modular API endpoints.

database.py: Handles database connection logic.

requirements.txt: Lists all project dependencies.

README.md: Provides specific instructions and details for that task.

```
‚ú® Key Concepts and Technologies
Across these projects, a variety of key backend development concepts and tools have been implemented:

FastAPI: The primary framework for building all APIs, leveraging its speed and asynchronous capabilities.

SQLModel: A powerful library for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), combining the simplicity of Pydantic with the power of SQLAlchemy to define database models and schemas.

Dependency Injection: Extensively used for managing database sessions and handling security dependencies like user authentication.

JWT Authentication: Implemented a robust, token-based authentication system using python-jose for secure user access to protected routes.

Password Hashing: Utilized passlib with the bcrypt algorithm to securely store user passwords in the database.

Middleware: Custom middleware functions were developed to perform tasks such as:

Logging requests.

Counting total requests.

Adding custom headers (e.g., response time).

Rejecting requests based on headers.

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): Configured the API to securely interact with frontend applications.

Modular Architecture: Projects are structured with routers to keep the codebase organized and scalable.

Database Management: Used SQLite as a lightweight database, with models and tables automatically created on application startup.

üìù Project Summaries
Task 1: Student Management System
A basic CRUD API to manage student records. This project introduced core concepts like SQLModel, database dependency injection, and basic file-based authentication.

Task 2: E-Commerce API
An API for a simplified e-commerce platform with public and admin-only endpoints. This task demonstrated a modular project structure, implemented JWT authentication, and added middleware for performance logging.

Task 3: Job Application Tracker
A secure application tracker where users can manage their job applications. Key features included user-specific data access, endpoint filtering via query parameters, and defensive middleware to handle missing headers.

Task 4: Notes API
A personal notes management system featuring CRUD operations. This project explored database and file storage, implemented a request-counting middleware, and configured CORS for multiple origins.

Task 5: Contact Manager API
A complete, end-to-end contact management system. This final project integrated all previously learned concepts, including JWT authentication, a relational database, and custom middleware to log client IP addresses. It serves as a comprehensive example of a production-ready FastAPI application.
